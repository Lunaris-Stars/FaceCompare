# Face Recognition Application

Welcome to the Face Recognition Application! This project is a user-friendly desktop application that utilizes advanced face recognition technology to compare and identify faces in images. Built with Python, PyQt5, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library, this application provides an intuitive interface for users to upload images and receive instant feedback on face similarity.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Easily upload two images for comparison.
- **Face Comparison**: The application analyzes the images and determines if the faces are similar.
- **Similarity Percentage**: Get a detailed percentage indicating how closely the faces match.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The following libraries (see `requirements.txt` for specific versions):
  - PyQt5
  - OpenCV
  - face_recognition

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files to your local machine.
